Design notes:

1.  We're allowing users to put a record on the queue even if it is already rented.
    Maybe you want to listen to the same record in 1 week.
    I.e. you can have a record rented, and also have it on the queue.
    But you cannot rent a record twice, or put it on the queue twice.

2.  Getting tests to work is proving pretty time consuming. Will prioritize adding
    enough code to get this working, since I don't think I'll have enough time for
    everything.
